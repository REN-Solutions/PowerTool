# PowerTool
The idea behind this is to create a IT Helpdesk Tool for troubleshooting remote (and local) workstations.   

This is a GUI menu and "Shell" for any tools you want to add to it.  It is non-functional as it is currently published.  

The PowerTool.ps1 creates a GUI menu and calls functions from the Fuction Directory.  

* Running PowerTool.ps1 will start open the main menu. 
* Type in a local workstation name or IP address and click Connnect. 
* Once connected to a workstation it will populate the full list of drop down menus.
